### Statement 

[https://codeforces.com/contest/1707/problem/E](https://codeforces.com/contest/1707/problem/E)

### Solution

The main observation is that we can break up a range $(l, r)$ to $(l, l+1), (l+1, l+2), \dots, (r-1, r)$. That means that if we want to perform function $f$ on range $(l, r)$ $k$ times, it is equivelent to the minimum and maximum point of performing $f$ on ranges $(a_l, a_{l+1}), (a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}), \dots, (a_{r-1}, a_r)$.

Then, we can precompute where each range $(\min(a_i, a_{i+1}), \max(a_i, a_{i+1}))$ would result in after performing $2^k$ operations. After this, we can binary search on the answer by using binary lifting.

The time complexity is $\mathcal O(N\log^2 N + Q\log N)$
