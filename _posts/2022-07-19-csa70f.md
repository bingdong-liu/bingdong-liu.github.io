### Statement 

[https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/and-or-max](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/and-or-max)

### Solution

The difficult part about this problem is that $\max$ is difficult to maintain with bitwise $\lor$ and $\land$ operations.

The first observation is that after a range of elements have been assigned to $a_i\lor x$, the $1$-bits of $x$ will become irrevelent for this range because all of them will share the same $0/1$. For $\land$ operations, all the $0$-bits will become irrevelent.

This inspires a "brute force" solution that only puts a lazy or/and tag if the operation changes the fixed bits in the range. This can be done by maintaining subtree $\lor$s, $\land$s, and $\max$s.
